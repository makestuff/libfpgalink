	 * @brief Load an XSVF file and convert it to CSVF
	 *
	 * XSVF is a weird format. It represents everything (even long bit-sequences) in big-endian,
	 * which is daft because to play a bit-sequence into the JTAG chain, you have to seek forward
	 * to the end of the bit-sequence, then read backwards until you get to the beginning, playing
	 * bytes into the JTAG chain as you go. This is fine on a powerful desktop computer with lots of
	 * memory, but a resource-constrained microcontroller would have trouble.
	 *
	 * The CSVF format ("Compressed Serial Vector Format") swaps the byte order so bit sequences
	 * can be played by reading forwards, and it replaces each XSDRB, XSDRC*, XSDRE command sequence
	 * with one big XSDR command.
	 *
	 * @param xsvfFile The XSVF filename.
	 * @param csvfBuf A pointer to a \c Buffer to be populated with the CSVF data.
	 * @param maxBufSize A pointer to a \c uint32 which will be set on exit to the number of bytes
	 *            necessary for buffering in the playback logic.
	 * @param error A pointer to a <code>char*</code> which will be set on exit to an allocated
	 *            error message if something goes wrong. Responsibility for this allocated memory
	 *            passes to the caller and must be freed with \c flFreeError(). If \c error is
	 *            \c NULL, no allocation is done and no message is returned, but the return code
	 *            will still be valid.
	 * @returns
	 *     - \c FL_SUCCESS if the command completed successfully.
	 *     - \c FL_BUF_INIT_ERR If the CSVF buffer could not be allocated.
	 *     - \c FL_BUF_APPEND_ERR If the CSVF buffer could not be grown.
	 *     - \c FL_BUF_LOAD_ERR If the XSVF file could not be loaded.
	 *     - \c FL_UNSUPPORTED_CMD_ERR If the XSVF file contains an unsupported command.
	 *     - \c FL_UNSUPPORTED_DATA_ERR if the XSVF file contains an unsupported XENDIR or XENDDR.
	 *     - \c FL_UNSUPPORTED_SIZE_ERR if the XSVF file requires more buffer space than is available.
