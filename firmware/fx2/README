The build process builds two separate firmwares:

   * A RAM firmware which renumerates on startup
   * An EEPROM firmware which does not renumerate on startup

These are committed to source-control under gen_fw so people can build the library itself without
needing to build the firmware. To rebuild these two firmwares, the process is as follows:

  make clean; make;                  cp firmware.hex ../../gen_fw/ramFirmware.hex
  make clean; make FLAGS="-DEEPROM"; cp firmware.hex ../../gen_fw/eepromNoBootFirmware.hex

The EEPROM firmware may be customised with board-specific initialisation:

  make clean; make FLAGS="-DEEPROM -DBSP=aes220" DID=0003
  make clean; make FLAGS="-DEEPROM -DBSP=nexys2" DID=0004

The customized "DID" allows multiple FPGALink units to be connected simultaneously, and individually
addressed.
