The build process builds two separate firmwares:

   * A RAM firmware which renumerates on startup
   * An EEPROM firmware which does not renumerate on startup

These are built by the build.sh script, which produces two "*Firmware.c" files in ../../src, which
are committed to source-control so people can build the library itself without needing to build the
firmware. Running "build.sh YYYYMMDD" with the date of the previous build will allow you to do a
git diff to check if anything has actually changed. If so, just run "build.sh" on its own to update
the version.

The EEPROM firmware may be customised with board-specific initialisation and/or a customized DID:

  make clean; make FLAGS="-DEEPROM -DBSP=aes220" DID=0003
  make clean; make FLAGS="-DEEPROM -DBSP=nexys2" DID=0004

The customized "DID" allows multiple FPGALink units to be connected simultaneously, and individually
addressed.
