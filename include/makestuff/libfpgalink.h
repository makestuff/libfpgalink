 * The <b>FPGALink</b> library makes it easier to talk to an FPGA over USB (via a suitable micro).
 *
 * It performs three classes of function:
 * - Load device firmware and EEPROM (specific to Cypress FX2LP).
 * - Program an FPGA or CPLD using JTAG or one of the proprietary serial or parallel algorithms.
 * - Read and write (over USB) up to 128 byte-wide data channels in the target FPGA.
 * - Manipulate microcontroller digital I/O and SPI port(s).

	 * @brief Program a device using the specified file.
	 *
	 * This will program an FPGA or CPLD using the specified microcontroller ports and the specified
	 * programming file. Several programming algorithms are supported (JTAG, Xilinx Slave-Serial,
	 * Xilinx SelectMap and Altera Passive-Serial). In each case, it's necessary to tell the micro
	 * which ports to use. Here are some examples:
	 *
	 * A Digilent board using JTAG: <code>progConfig="J:D0D2D3D4"</code>:
	 * - TDO: PD0
	 * - TDI: PD2
	 * - TMS: PD3
	 * - TCK: PD4
	 *
	 * MakeStuff LX9 using JTAG: <code>progConfig="J:A7A0A3A1"</code>:
	 * - TDO: PA7
	 * - TDI: PA0
	 * - TMS: PA3
	 * - TCK: PA1
	 *
	 * EP2C5 Mini Board using Altera Passive-Serial: <code>progConfig="AS:B5B6B1B2"</code> (note
	 * that the board normally connects MSEL[1:0] to ground, hard-coding it in Active-Serial mode.
	 * For Passive-Serial to work you need to lift pin 85 and pull it up to VCC):
	 * - nCONFIG: PD5
	 * - CONF_DONE: PD6
	 * - DCLK: PD1
	 * - DATA0: PD2
	 *
	 * Aessent aes220 using Xilinx Slave-Serial:
	 * <code>progConfig="XS:D0D5D1D6A7[D3?,B1+,B5+,B3+]"</code>:
	 * - PROG_B: PD0
	 * - INIT_B: PD5
	 * - DONE: PD1
	 * - CCLK: PD6
	 * - DIN: PA7
	 * - Tristate DOUT (PD3)
	 * - Drive M[2:0]="111" (PB1, PB5, PB3) for Slave-Serial
	 *
	 * Aessent aes220 using Xilinx SelectMAP:
	 * <code>progConfig="XP:D0D5D1D6A01234567[B4-,D2-,D3?,B1+,B5+,B3-]"</code>:
	 * - PROG_B: PD0
	 * - INIT_B: PD5
	 * - DONE: PD1
	 * - CCLK: PD6
	 * - D[7:0]: PA[7:0]
	 * - Drive RDWR_B="0" (PB4)
	 * - Drive CSI_B="0" (PD2)
	 * - Tristate DOUT (PD3)
	 * - Drive M[2:0]="110" (PB1, PB5, PB3) for SelectMAP
	 *
	 * Note that this approach of specifying and implementing many disparate programming algorithms
	 * on the host side in terms of a much smaller set of building-block operations on the
	 * microcontroller is optimized for microcontrollers which support efficient remapping of I/O
	 * pins. For example the FX2 has a Von Neumann architecture where both code and data are stored
	 * in a single RAM-based address space, so port remapping can easily be achieved with
	 * self-modifying code. Conversely, the AVRs have Harvard architecture, where code and data are
	 * in separate address spaces, with code in flash so it cannot be self-modified. And actually,
	 * the AVR firmware is more likely to be tuned to a specific board layout than the more generic
	 * FX2 firmware.
	 *
	 * So, the bottom line is, even if you're using a microcontroller whose port pins are
	 * hard-coded, you still have to supply the port pins to use when you call functions expecting
	 * \c progConfig.
	 *
	 * You can either append the programming filename to the end of \c progConfig (e.g
	 * \c "J:A7A0A3A1:fpga.xsvf") or you can supply the programming filename separately in
	 * \c progFile.
	 *
	 * @param handle The handle returned by \c flOpen().
	 * @param progConfig The port configuration described above.
	 * @param progFile The name of the programming file, or \c NULL if it's already given in
	 *            \c progConfig.
	 * @param error A pointer to a <code>const char*</code> which will be set on exit to an
	 *            allocated error message if something goes wrong. Responsibility for this
	 *            allocated memory passes to the caller and must be freed with \c flFreeError(). If
	 *            \c error is \c NULL, no allocation is done and no message is returned, but the
	 *            return code will still be valid.
